# Call-to-Action Coding Challenge

## Setup

#### 1. After installing the packages, use `npm run init` to initialize your project. You can customize the preview here: .storybook/manager.js

#### 2. Create new components with `npm run generate` - Don't forget to use a dash in the component's name! There is already an example component in the components folder where we used Storybook Knobs and Faker, to give you an idea :)

#### 3. Start the build and serve process with `npm start`.
